## üìù Writeup

### ‚ùì What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  
The most challenging part was making the Sudoku grids look correct and aligning the subgrids (3√ó3 inside 9√ó9, 2√ó3 inside 6√ó6). CSS grid layout took time to get right, especially when combining borders and spacing. I also had to carefully structure my project folders so that each page had its own `index.html` with page-specific CSS while still sharing the `common.css` file. Overall, working with HTML was straightforward, but getting consistent responsive CSS styling was more challenging. This assignment took me around **15 hours** total.  

### üì± What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?  
I decided to make the navbar responsive by ensuring it stays fixed at the top on desktop but adapts in mobile view. I used media queries so that elements scale properly and text/images shrink for smaller screens. I also applied flexbox/grid for the Sudoku boards so they keep a square aspect ratio across devices. The result is that the website looks clean on both a desktop browser and on an iPhone Pro 12 simulation in DevTools.  

### üé® What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  
I wanted the site to feel simple and consistent, so I used card layouts with rounded corners, drop shadows, and a dark-accent theme. The navbar highlights the current page, which makes navigation clearer. I am proud of the Sudoku grids since they look realistic without using JavaScript, and of the overall organization into folders which makes the site easy to maintain.  

### üöÄ Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?  
I would add real puzzle logic with JavaScript so players could actually solve Sudoku puzzles and check answers. I would also add a functioning timer, a scoreboard that stores data, and user accounts with persistent logins. Another idea is to add theming options so players can switch between light and dark modes.  

### ‚è∞ How many hours did you spend on this assignment?  
~15 hours.  

### (Optional) Assumptions  
I assumed the timer and high scores only needed to be static mockups, not functional. I also assumed it was fine to use fake author names and user names in the selection and high score pages.  

### (Optional) Code/Design Sources  
- Navbar and grid layout: coded by me, but inspired by general CSS flexbox/grid tutorials.  
- Fonts: default system fonts only (no external imports).  
- Image: `homepage.png` (Sudoku board) stored locally in `/assets/img/`.
